* 1 lb Chicken Breast
* 1 Egg
* 1 Cup Bread Crumbs
* 1/2 Cup Oil
* 1 Cup Sauce (your choice!)

Cube the chicken into 1-inch blocks. Place the egg in one bowl and beat, and the bread crumbs, salt, and pepper in another and mix. Dredge the chicken first in the egg, then in the bread crumbs (repeat for thicker breading) and lay on a baking sheet. Place enough oil in a pan to coat the bottom well and heat until just before it begins to smoke (you want the oil hot so the chicken doesn't "sponge" up the oil). Fry the breaded chicken in batches, each time replacing enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Toss in the sauce of your choice and serve immediately.

## Notes

* Half sweet barbeque, half Frank's Buffalo Sauce makes a really tasty spicy barbecue.
* You can crumble feta or blue cheese into the bread crumb mixture to give the breading some more flavor
* If you intend to have leftovers, don't sauce before storing. Reheat in the oven prior to saucing.
