* 2-4 lb Top Round for London Broil
* 1/3 Cup Soy Sauce
* 1/3 Cup Olive Oil
* 1/3 Cup Worcestershire Sauce
* 1/3 Cup Lemon Juice
* 1 Clove Minced Garlic
* Parsley
* Black Pepper

Place all ingredients in a gallon Ziploc and remove as much air as possible (can try sucking through a straw or placing the bag under water). Marinade 24 hours. Heat a gas grill as hot as it will go and use a meat thermometer. Flip once at 100F, remove at 140F and let it sit under a foil tent. Slice across the grain and serve.

## Notes

* Lemon juice acts as a tenderizer, but lime juice may be used in a pinch
* It is also possible to do this in an oven, searing the outside first on the stovetop
